			<p> Ulysses Management LP is a Singapore-based limited partnership focussed on long-term US and Asian equities. 
We are value investors in the spirit of Buffett, Munger, Li and Zhang.
We have one simple goal:
Beat the market on a long-term basis by a large margin.

			<h1> We look for the business that beats the other businesses.

		<div class = "rows fade-in">
			<p> We look for companies with one key thing: superior competitive dynamics.
This could come from a lot of things, from insurmountable scale economics and uncapped pricing power to fanatic management and overwhelming market growth.
We take a forensic fundamental approach to evaluating this. 
We visit stores, pose as customers. 
We even speak to security personnel and contact old managers. 
We put ourselves in the position of business owners, and like them we invest for the long-haul and with high conviction. </p>

We concentrate instead of diversify, holding at most 10 distinct positions at a time.
We prioritise opportunity cost and the risk of our own ignorance.
And we're unafraid to destroy our own best-loved ideas, quickly and effectively.

At no point will we ever make money when our clients don't.
And we, along with our friends and family, are all significantly invested at the same terms of our clients.

We're not afraid to say investing is our calling.
It's what we were made to do.

Our founder and general partner, Christian Goh, began investing for his family in late-2018 and founded the partnership in 2020 while studying in college.
He has served as the sole portfolio manager since Ulysses' inception from an initial seed investment of less than USD20,000 to over USD360,000 today. 
Christian was born and raised in Singapore. 
Prior to founding Ulysses, he held teaching positions for online mathematics and psychology courses at Stanford and Wesleyan University, 
				and worked as an analyst at a private equity startup.
He currently reads economics and French (honours, highest distinction; repeated Dean's and Dean's Scholars List)
				at the National University of Singapore.
